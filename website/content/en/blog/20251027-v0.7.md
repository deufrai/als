For a while, the stars went quiet.  
But with **version 0.7**, *Astro Live Stacker* shines again — rebuilt, refined, and ready to make your nights under the sky smoother than ever.

This release is the result of several years of patient work, endless cups of coffee, and a stubborn love for both code and starlight.  
It marks a turning point for ALS: cleaner, more capable, fully documented, and finally ready for everyone.

## 🪐 A Personal Note

ALS began as a community experiment.  
Today, I’m proud to keep it alive as its main maintainer — building on the foundations laid by the original ALS team.

Version 0.7 isn’t just another number.  
It’s proof that open-source projects can outlive their beginnings when people care enough to finish the work.

Thank you to everyone who tested, translated, reported bugs, and encouraged me along the way.  
Clear skies, and happy stacking 🌌

— **Frédéric Cornu**  
Maintainer of *Astro Live Stacker*
