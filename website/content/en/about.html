    <h1>What is Astro Live Stacker?</h1>
    <p>
        Astro Live Stacker (ALS) is an open-source application dedicated to live astrophotography.
    </p>
    <p>
        Its primary role is to enable real-time processing of astronomical images, a
        technique
        called livestacking.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach involves aligning and stacking successive images as they are
        acquired to enhance their quality by revealing more details and reducing noise.
    </p>
    <p>
        ALS handles diverse image formats and runs seamlessly across desktop and embedded platforms — from Linux, Windows,
        and macOS to Raspberry Pi — and lets you share live stacking sessions through its integrated web server.

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>ALS was born in 2019 from an initial attempt at livestacking using <a
                        href="https://stellarmate.com/downloads/ekos/category/2-ekos.html" target="_blank">Ekos</a> to
                    control
                    <a href="https://siril.org/" target="_blank">Siril</a> via custom shell scripts. These shell scripts
                    then evolved into Python code. What started as a small toy for a few friends spending their nights
                    photographing the universe has grown into a full-fledged application used worldwide.
