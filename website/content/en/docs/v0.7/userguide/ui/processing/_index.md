# Introduction

In this chapter, you will learn how to improve your images using the `Processing` panel.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

# Overview

The `Processing` panel is the control room for the **Process** module in ALS.

Located on the right side of the interface, this panel organizes image processing controls into several sections:

- [**Histogram**](#histogram-section)  
  A graphical representation of pixel intensity distribution.

- [**Auto Stretch**](#stretch-section)  
  Adjust the strength of the automatic stretch.

- [**Levels**](#levels-section)  
  Fine-tune overall exposure and adjust black and white clipping.

- [**RGB Balance**](#rgb-balance-section)  
  Adjust the red, green, and blue levels for color correction.

# Histogram {#histogram-section}

The **Histogram** provides a graphical representation of the intensity distribution of pixels within the currently displayed image.

This tool is essential for quickly evaluating tonal and color balance.

## Graph Properties

- **Horizontal Axis:** Indicates pixel intensity, ranging from shadows on the left (low intensity) to highlights on the right (high intensity).
- **Vertical Axis:** Represents the number of pixels at each intensity level. Higher peaks indicate more pixels within that tonal range.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

## Monochrome Mode

For monochrome images, a single curve is displayed, showing the intensity distribution of all pixels.

</div>

<div class="col-md-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="histo_mono.png"
caption="Monochrome Histogram"
width="321px"
height="148px"
alt="Dynamic histogram reflecting the intensity distribution of pixels in a monochrome image." >}}
{{< /center >}}
</div>
</div>

## Color Mode

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

For color images, the histogram displays separate curves for the three channels: red, green, and blue.

Each curve represents the pixel intensity distribution within its respective channel, showing how each color contributes to the image.

Overlapping regions are displayed in mixed colors that represent the resulting blend.

# Processing Controls {#controls-section}

This section consolidates the controls for the **Process** module and its three image processors:
- Auto Stretch
- Levels
- RGB Balance

The controls for each processor are grouped into sections, each with its own sliders and buttons:

## Adjustments

Each slider corresponds to an adjustable parameter. No numerical values are displayed, encouraging a more visual and intuitive approach.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è All sliders in this `Processing` panel feature an additional action:  
üñ±Ô∏è **Double-click** the slider handle to reset it to its default position.
{{% /alert %}}

## Managing and Applying Settings

- `Apply` Generates a new image based on the current slider positions.  
  The central view and histogram update automatically once processing completes.
- `Default` Resets all sliders to their default positions without altering the currently displayed image.
- `Reload` Returns the sliders to the positions they were in when `Apply` was last clicked, without modifying the currently displayed image.
- `Active` Enables or disables the processor. Changing this toggle generates a new image immediately, without needing to click `Apply`.

# Image Adjustments

## Auto Stretch {#stretch-section}

The **Auto Stretch** section adjusts the intensity of the automatic stretch applied to the image, making stacked images visually usable.

üñ±Ô∏è Adjust the stretch intensity using the `Strength` slider.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Default: **An ideal balance defined by ALS.**

## Levels {#levels-section}

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

### Black

üñ±Ô∏è Adjust the `Black` slider to set the threshold for dark tones.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Default: Leftmost position.

- **Analyze the histogram:** Observe the far left of the histogram and check the distance between the curves and the left edge.
- **Goal:** Position the curves to just touch the left edge to optimize dark tones without clipping.

*Moving the slider to the right shifts the curves to the left.*

alt="Histogram showing the curves after precise adjustments to black levels." >}}
</div>
</div>

### White

üñ±Ô∏è Adjust the `White` slider to set the threshold for bright tones.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Default: Rightmost position.

- **Goal:** Visually balance the brightness of highlights while preserving details.

*Moving the slider to the left shifts the curves to the right.*

### Exposure

üñ±Ô∏è Adjust the `Exposure` slider to control overall brightness.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Default: Center position.

- **Goal:** Find the brightness level that best highlights your target, relying on visual perception.

*Moving the slider to the right brightens the image.*

## RGB Balance {#balance-section}

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
  {{% alert color="info" %}}
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Available only for color images.
  {{% /alert %}}

  The **RGB Balance** section adjusts the red, green, and blue levels for improved overall color balance.

  ### Analyze the Histogram

  Observe the relative positions of the peaks of the three curves.

</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

  ### Your Goal

  Achieving a neutral color balance by vertically aligning the main peaks of the three curves is often a good starting point. 

  Aligning peaks often maximizes the white area of the histogram.

<div class="col-md-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column">

  <div class="mb-3">

    height="146px"
    alt="Histogram showing aligned peaks for RGB curves in a color-neutral image." >}}
  </div>

<div class="col-md-8">

{{% alert color="light" %}}
üí° Depending on the target and equipment, histogram curves may lack distinct peaks.

Example: For a target dominated by H-alpha, the red curve will appear flattened without a prominent peak.

The blended colors of the histogram effectively reflect the image's red dominance.

<div class="col-md-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-column">

  <div>

    width="320px"
    height="146px"
    alt="Histogram showing the red dominance of a correctly adjusted H-alpha image." >}}
  </div>

</div>
</div>

### Slider Actions

Each slider adjusts the horizontal position of its respective curve.

*Moving the slider to the right shifts the curve to the right.*
