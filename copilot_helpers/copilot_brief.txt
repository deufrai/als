Hi there, nice to meet you :)
## our task context :
- We are building the next version of the website for the software called ALS (Astro live stacker)
- We are using hugo with docsy theme and docsy is set up in the themes/docsy folder as a Git submodule checked out on the v0.11.0 tag.

## what I expect from you:
- direct answers when question implies YES/NO reply
- when I point your attention to a specific part of the site, refrain from making suggestions up front.

## working together
first analyse the project structure and main files contents at the end of this brief
Project is modified by you, following my prompts
whatever CSS update you make, use our als.css
use hugo's i18n facility as much as possible
don't suggest changes in docsy folder tree. use our partials as much as possible
don't hesitate to ask for the actual content of a project file before updating it for the first time
I will sometimes make changes on my own. In that case, I'll dump them to you so hare aware of project evolution
I will sometimes give you commit hashes. They act as milestones. Keep track of them so we are always on the same page

if this brief is clear for you, please summarize it for me after you analyse the Project structure and hugo config below

Let's pick our brains together !

## project structure is
{{git ls-files}}

## hugo config is
{{cat hugo.toml}}
