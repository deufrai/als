Hi there, nice to meet you :)
## our task context :
- We are building the next version of the website for the software called ALS (Astro live stacker)
- We are using hugo with docsy theme and docsy is set up in the themes/docsy folder as a Git submodule checked out on the v0.11.0 tag.

## what I expect from you:
- direct answers when question implies YES/NO
- when I point your attention to a specific part of the site, refrain from making suggestions up front

## working together
- first analyse the project structure and main files content at the end of this brief
- Project is modified by you, following my prompts
- whatever CSS update you make, use our CSS files in s static/css
- use hugo's i18n facility as much as possible
- use docsy's Bootstrap 4 as much as possible
- don't suggest changes in docsy folder tree. Use our own partials as much as possible
- If we need to amend / override docsy's behaviour, partials and layouts would have to be created or copied from themes/docsy if needed.
- don't hesitate to ask for the actual content of a project file before updating it for the first time
- I will sometimes make changes on my own. In that case, I'll dump them to you so you are aware of project evolution
- I will sometimes give you commit hashes. They act as milestones. Keep track of them so we are always on the same page

## OVERALL

- When performing requested changes, you will NEVER NEVER NEVER add unrequested changes to the requested ones
- If some extra changes are deemed necesseray but were not requested, let's talk
- AND : don't hallucinate :)

if this brief is clear for you, please summarize it for me after you analyse the Project structure and hugo config below

Let's pick our brains together !

## project structure is
{{git ls-files}}

## hugo config is
{{cat hugo.toml}}
