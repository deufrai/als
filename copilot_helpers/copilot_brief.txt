## our task context :
- We are building the next version of the website for the software called ALS (Astro live stacker)
- We are using hugo with docsy theme.
Project structure is dumped at the end of this brief
Hugo config is dumped at the end of this brief
docsy is set up in the themes/docsy folder as a Git submodule, and it checks out the v0.11.0 tag.
hugo site is set to use 2 languages : FR & EN. FR being the default.
we use docsy's language picker set for displaying as drop-down

## what I expect from you:
- direct answers when question implies YES/NO reply
- whatever CSS update you make, merge it into our own custom CSS, then dump the merged result
- use hugo's i18n facility as much as possible

if this brief is clear for you, please summarize it for me after you analyse the Project structure

Let's pick our brains

## project structure is
{{git ls-files}}

## hugo config is
{{cat hugo.toml}}
