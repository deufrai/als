## Scan Folder {#scan-folder}

Defines the path of the folder monitored by ALS to detect subs recorded by your acquisition system.

{{% alert color="light" %}}
üí° Detection works regardless of the subfolder structure within the **scan folder**.

If your acquisition system records subs in subfolders organized by target or date, set the **scan folder** to the parent
folder of these subfolders.
