The vast majority of application settings are managed through the **Preferences** window.

Preferences are divided into 3 groups:

- General: Main application settings
- Process: Image processing settings
- Output: Disk and server output settings

{{% alert color="info" %}}
ℹ️ All settings are saved as soon as the preferences window is closed using the `OK` button.
