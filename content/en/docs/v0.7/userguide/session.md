## Setup

Whether you’re shooting DSO live, preparing data for detailed post-processing or diving into something more artistic,
these steps will help you get the best out of ALS every time.

### Choose Your Profile

<div class="col-md-6">

- **Electronically Assisted Astronomy**: For live imaging with short exposures of a few seconds 

  ALS processes subs rapidly, producing vibrant, viewable images in real time.

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">

- **Astrophoto**: For long exposures of several minutes 

  ALS acts as an acquisition and data diagnostic tool, giving you a high-quality preview of your fully processed image.

### Prep Your Calibration

Do you have a master dark that matches your sensor and temperature?

If yes, use **Dark Subtraction** to clean up thermal noise

### Adjust Stacking Settings

- Use **Alignment** Deep Sky Objects imaging, or disable it for artistic shots such as star trails or time-lapses.

- Set **Stacking Mode**:
    - **Mean** for smooth and noise-free results.
    - **Sum** for amplified brightness and a creative twist.

## Session in Motion

Start the session and let ALS do its thing. 

Here’s how to keep everything running smoothly and eventually enjoy the results.

### Stay on Top of Processing

Keep track of your session by reviewing ALS feedbacks on performance and potential issues regarding subs processing


### Adapt to Conditions 

Adapt threshold to match changing weather conditions or acquisition setup specifics.

### Shape Your Image as You Go

tweak ALS image processing settings to adjust the image as it develops with each new sub

### Dive Into Your Image

Explore the details of your stacked image:
- Zoom in to capture intricate features.
- Pan across the frame to find areas that deserve attention.

### Share Your Progress

Want others to see what you’re working on? ALS makes it easy to share your session live:

- **Public Outreach**: Engage your audience at astronomy events with live updates of your evolving image.
- **Collaboration**: Share your session with team members or clubmates to enhance group discussions and projects.
