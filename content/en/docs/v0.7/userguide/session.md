# 📘 Introduction

This chapter is your roadmap for running an ALS successful session and monitoring its progress.

It wraps up the presentation of ALS main concepts before you dive into the user interface.

## ⚙️ Session Setup

Whether you’re shooting DSO live, preparing data for detailed post-processing, or diving into something more artistic, these steps will help you get the best out of ALS every time.

### 🗂️ Choose Your Profile

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

- **Electronically Assisted Astronomy**: For live imaging with short exposures of a few seconds.  

  ALS processes subs rapidly, producing vibrant, viewable images in real time.

</div>

<div class="col-md-6">

- **Astrophoto**: For long exposures of several minutes.  

  ALS acts as an acquisition and data diagnostic tool, giving you a high-quality preview of your fully processed image.

### 🧪 Prep Your Calibration

Do you have a master dark that matches your sensor and temperature?  
If yes, use **Dark Subtraction** to clean up thermal noise.

### 🛠️ Adjust Stacking Settings

- Use **Alignment** Deep Sky Objects imaging, or disable it for artistic shots such as star trails or time-lapses.

- Set **Stacking Mode**:
    - **Mean** for smooth and noise-free results.
    - **Sum** for amplified brightness and a creative twist.

## 🚀 Session in Motion

Start the session and let ALS do its thing. 

Here’s how to keep everything running smoothly and eventually enjoy the results.

### 📊 Stay on Top of Things

Keep track of your session by reviewing ALS feedback on performance and potential issues during subs processing.

### 🌦️ Adapt to Conditions

Adapt the alignment threshold to match changing weather conditions or specific acquisition setups.

### 🎨 Tweak Your Image

Tweak ALS image processing settings to adjust the image as it develops with each new sub.

### 🔍 Dive Into Your Image

Explore the details of your stacked image:  
- Zoom in to capture intricate features.  
- Pan across the frame to find areas that deserve attention.

### 🌐 Share Your Progress

Perfect for public outreach or collaborative discussions :

Let others follow your session live by activating the image server and sharing the generated QR code. 

Viewers can explore your evolving image with the same image browsing features as the main ALS app, optimized for both 
desktop and mobile devices.

## 📦 Wrap Things Up

When your session ends, you'll find the final result image in your **work folder**.

## 🎯 Conclusion

It is now time for **you** to take control of ALS by diving into the next chapter: ALS user interface.
