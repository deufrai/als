### ✔️ Prep Your Calibration

Do you have a master dark that matches your sensor and temperature?  
If yes, use **Dark Subtraction** to clean up thermal noise.

### ✔️ Adjust Stacking Settings

- Enable **Alignment** for Deep Sky Objects imaging, or disable it for artistic shots such as star trails or time-lapses.

- Set **Stacking Mode**:
    - **Mean** for smooth and noise-free results.
    - **Sum** for amplified brightness and a creative twist.

## 🚀 Progress

Start the session and let ALS do its thing... 

Here’s how to keep everything running smoothly and eventually enjoy the results:

### 📊 Stay on Top of Things

Keep track of your session by reviewing ALS feedback on performance and potential issues during subs processing.

### 🌦️ Adapt to Conditions

Adapt the alignment threshold to match changing weather conditions or specific acquisition setups.

### 🎨 Tweak Your Image

Tweak ALS image processing settings to adjust the image as it develops with each new sub.

### 🔍 Dive Into Your Image

Zoom in/out and pan across the image to find areas that deserve attention or just to enjoy the view.

### 🌐 Share Your Progress

Perfect for public outreach or collaborative discussions :

Let others follow your session live by activating the image server and sharing the generated QR code. 

Viewers can explore your evolving image with the same image browsing features as the main ALS app, optimized for both 
desktop and mobile devices.

## 📦 Wrap Up

Stop your session and find the final result image in your **work folder**.
