# Introduction

By the end of this chapter, you‚Äôll know everything about ALS's message management system.

# Overview

The `Session Log` consolidates the management of messages generated by ALS and is divided into two main parts:
- [**Log View:**](#log-view) Displays messages in real time.
- [**Control Buttons:**](#control-buttons) Allow you to follow, filter, and manage log entries.

The `Session Log` not only lets you monitor your session's progress but also facilitates troubleshooting and performance analysis.

# Log View {#log-view}

The **Log View** displays messages in chronological order, with the most recent ones appearing at the bottom.

Each entry includes:
- **Timestamp:** The time the message was recorded.
- **Type:** The importance level of the message: INFO, WARNING, or ERROR.
- **Details:** A description of the event.

When an unexpected event occurs during a session (e.g., file processing error or task failure), it is logged as either a **WARNING** or **ERROR** based on its severity:

- **WARNING:** A problem that can likely be ignored without significantly affecting the session.
- **ERROR:** A problem that may impact the session‚Äôs results.

Examples of messages:

- INFO Image saved: web_image.jpg
- WARNING Could not stack image \[...\] Image is DISCARDED
- ERROR Failed to save image  \[...\]

### Copying Messages

Clicking on any log entry automatically copies its content to the clipboard, making it easy to share or analyze.

# Control Buttons {#control-buttons}
