# Introduction

This section explains how to stay informed about events occurring during your session.

# Overview

The `Session Log` is divided into two main parts:

- [**Log View:**](#log-view) A chronological list of recorded messages displayed in real time.
- [**Control Buttons:**](#control-buttons) Interactive options to filter, follow, and manage log entries.

It is designed not only to monitor processes but also to assist in troubleshooting and performance analysis.

# Log View {#log-view}

The **Log View** displays messages in chronological order, with the most recent ones at the bottom.

Each entry includes:
- **Timestamp:** The exact time the message was recorded.
- **Type:** The importance level of the message, such as INFO, WARNING, or ERROR.
- **Details:** A description of the event.

When an unexpected event occurs during a session (e.g., file processing error or task failure), it is logged as a **WARNING** or **ERROR** depending on its severity:
- **WARNING:** A problem that can likely be ignored without significantly affecting the session.
- **ERROR:** A problem that may impact the session‚Äôs results.

Examples of messages:
- INFO: Image saved: web_image.jpg
- WARNING Could not stack image \[...\] Image is DISCARDED
- ERROR: Failed to save image \[...\]

### Copying Messages

Clicking on any log entry automatically copies its content to the clipboard, making it easier to share or analyze.
