# General Layout

The ALS interface is divided into the following elements:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

- 1: The main menu  
- 2: The "Main Controls" panel  
- 3: The central area  

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">

- 4: The "Processing" panel  
- 5: The "Session Log" panel  
- 6: The status bar  

  </div>
</div>

# Panels

- The **Main Controls** panel is located on the left side of the main window by default.
- The **Processing** panel is located on the right side of the main window by default.
- The **Session Log** panel is located at the bottom of the main window by default.

## Moving Panels

Panels can be docked to specific zones in the main window or detached to become independent floating elements. These floating panels can be freely positioned anywhere in the display area, even across multiple screens.

### Docked Mode
  - Click on the **title bar** of a panel and drag it towards a valid docking area:
    - The **Main Controls** and **Processing** panels can be docked to the left or right sides.
    - The **Session Log** panel can be docked to the top or bottom.
  - As you approach a valid docking zone, **visual indicators** appear to guide you.
  - Release the click to anchor the panel at the chosen location.

### Floating Mode
  - Click on the **title bar** of the panel you want to move.
  - Hold the click and drag the panel anywhere in the display area, then release the click.
  - The panel will remain floating and detached from the main window.

A floating panel can be re-docked to its default position by double-clicking on its title bar.

# Sliders

The **sliders** in ALS allow users to adjust various parameters in an intuitive way. Here are the different methods of interacting with them:

## Dragging the Handle
The most straightforward way to change a value:
- Click on the slider handle with your mouse.
- Hold the click and drag the handle to the left to decrease the value or to the right to increase it.
- Release the click once the desired value is reached.

## Using the Mouse Wheel
If you’re using a mouse with a scroll wheel, this can provide fine-tuned adjustments:
- Hover the mouse pointer over the slider handle or bar.
- Scroll the wheel upwards to increase the value or downwards to decrease it.

## Clicking on the Bar
Clicking directly on the slider bar adjusts the associated value in larger increments compared to using the mouse wheel:
- The slider handle moves accordingly but does not jump directly to the click position.

ℹ️ Certain sliders feature additional behaviors that are explained in the documentation of the specific panels where they are located.
