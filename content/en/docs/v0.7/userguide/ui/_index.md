<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

- 1: The main menu  
- 2: The "Main controls" panel  
- 3: The central area  

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
  
- 4: The "Processing" panel  
- 5: The "Session log" panel  
- 6: The status bar  

  </div>
</div>

# Panels

- The **Main controls** panel is placed by default on the left side of the main window.
- The **Processing** panel is placed by default on the right side of the main window.
- The **Session log** panel is placed by default at the bottom of the main window.

## Moving panels

Panels can be docked in specific areas of the main window or detached to become independent, allowing them to be freely placed anywhere in the available display area, including across multiple screens.

### Docked mode
  - Click on the **title bar** of the panel and drag it to an allowed docking area:
    - The **Main controls** and **Processing** panels can be docked to the left or right.
    - The **Session log** panel can be docked at the bottom or top.
  - When you approach a valid docking area, **visual indicators** will appear to guide you.
  - Release the click to fix the panel in the chosen location.

### Floating mode
  - Click on the **title bar** of the panel you want to move.
  - Hold the click and drag the panel to any location, then release the click.
  - The panel remains floating and independent of the main window.

A floating panel can be re-docked to its default position by double-clicking on its title bar.
