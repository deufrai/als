# Introduction

At the end of this chapter, you will have:

- Understood the organization and function of each section of the `Main Controls` panel
- Deepened your knowledge of the features controlled by these sections

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">

# Overview

The `Main Controls` panel is located on the left side of the interface.

It organizes the most used controls and displays into sections.

- [**Session**](#session-section)

  Session controls, stack information, and session status

- [**Stack**](#stack-section)

  Stacking settings: Alignment, stacking mode, and detection threshold

- [**Image Server**](#server-section)

  Image server controls and status

- [**Image Saver**](#saver-section)

  Image saving tools

- [**Workers**](#workers-section)

  Information on the usage status of the main modules

- [**Issues**](#issues-section)

  Issues indicator

# Session {#session-section}

The **session** section of the panel includes 3 areas:

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

## Session Controls {#session-controls}

- <span class="als-ks">R</span> or üñ±Ô∏è click `START` to start a new session or resume a paused session.
- <span class="als-ks">R</span> or üñ±Ô∏è click `PAUSE` to pause the current session.
- <span class="als-ks">X</span> or üñ±Ô∏è click `STOP` to stop the current session.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è Stopping a session with at least one sub in the **stack** displays a confirmation prompt.
{{% /alert %}}

## Stack Information

Below the session controls, you will find information about the **stack**:

- the number of subs currently in the **stack**
- the cumulative exposure times of the subs in the **stack**.

_In this example, we have stacked 39 subs for a total of 2m 36s._

## Session Status

Finally, the status of the current session.

_In this example, the session is running._

# Stack {#stack-section}

The **stack** section of the panel controls the **Stacker** module.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

## Alignment and Stacking Mode {#controls}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è These controls are accessible only when the session is stopped.
{{% /alert %}}
- <span class="als-ks">A</span> or üñ±Ô∏è check `Align` to enable subs **alignment**

- Use the dropdown list to set the **stacking mode** to use:
    - `mean`

      Used for electronically assisted astronomy or for monitoring a series of acquisitions.

      ‚öôÔ∏è _The value of each pixel in the generated stack is the **average value** of that pixel across all subs in the **stack**._

    - `sum`

      Used for creating star trails or circumpolar images.

      ‚öôÔ∏è _The value of each pixel in the generated stack is the **sum** of the values of that pixel across all subs in the **stack**._

## Detection Threshold {#threshold}

Alignment works by comparing the subs with the **alignment reference**, looking for similar star groups.

Poor quality subs, with too few or distorted stars, are discarded using a threshold:

Any sub with a number of similarities **below** this threshold is discarded.

üñ±Ô∏è Use the `Threshold` slider to adjust the value of this **detection threshold**.

**When a sub is discarded**:

- The sub is not added to the stack and the **Stacker** module waits for the next sub.
- A **WARNING** is added to the **Session log**. It contains the text '_Alignment matches count is lower than configured threshold_'
- The `Acknowledge` button in the `Session Log` panel is activated.

  _If the_ `session log` _panel is hidden, the issue indicator appears in the_ **Issues** _section._

{{% alert title="üí°" color="light" %}}
- Aim to set the detection threshold as high as possible without causing sub discards.
- Lowering the stacking threshold is useful for long focal length shots where stars are few.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="‚ÑπÔ∏è" color="info" %}}
- Alignment is enabled at each ALS startup.
- The stacking mode is set to **mean** at each ALS startup.
- The detection threshold is global and constantly saved.
{{% /alert %}}

# Image Server {#server-section}

The **Image Server** section of the panel controls the **Server** module.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

- <span class="als-ks">W</span> or üñ±Ô∏è click `STOP` to stop the server.

## Server Information

Below the server controls, you will find its status display.

When the server is **started**:
- its URL is added to the status.
- <span class="als-ks">Q</span> toggles the display of the QR code for the server URL.

</div>
<div class="col-md-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">

# Image Saver {#saver-section}

The **Image Saver** section of the panel allows triggering additional saves beyond the default operation of the **Save** module.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-8">

## Save Controls {#save-controls}

- <span class="als-ks">S</span> or üñ±Ô∏è click `Save current` to save the **last** processing result with a timestamp.

# Modules {#modules-section}

The **Modules** section of the panel displays details of each main module.

- The size of the associated queue.
- The module status: Displays **busy** when the module is processing an image.

The queue size for all modules is 0. The status of the Stack module is busy, while the statuses of the other modules are indicated by a dash (-)." >}}

# Issues {#issues-section}

When a new issue is detected **and the `Session Log` is hidden**, the `Issues` button appears in this section.
