# Introduction

By the end of this chapter, you will have:

- Configured the only required settings for a quick start with ALS's default settings.
- Started your first stacking session and obtained your first results.

# In the shoes of the character... {#character}

Throughout this journey, you will embody a new ALS user:

- **Username**: Your username is **astrogeek**
- **System used**: You use ALS on a Linux system
- **Organization of subs**: Your acquisition system saves the subs in the **astroshots** folder of your home
  directory, organized by target with subs in **Light** subfolders.

  Example: Session on Messier 27, the subs are saved in the **astroshots/M_27/Light** folder.

{{< /center >}}

# Initial Configuration

On the first start, ALS welcomes you and asks you to define two essential settings:

- **Scan folder**: The folder where ALS monitors the arrival of new subs.
- **Work folder**: The folder where ALS saves the produced images.

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="welcome.png"
caption="Welcome message"

height="172px"
alt="Welcome dialog box for ALS with text indicating it's the user's first use and instructions to set paths for the Scan and Work folders. An OK button is at the bottom right." >}}
{{< /center >}}

üñ±Ô∏è Click `OK` to access the preferences.

## Configure Critical Folders

The critical folders are defined in the **Paths** section of the **General** tab.

### Scan Folder

ALS monitors the arrival of new subs in this folder.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è Detection works regardless of the subfolder structure inside the **scan folder**.

## Usage Statistics

It is very useful for us to know which versions of ALS are being used and on which platform.

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="prefs_07.png"
caption="Checkbox indicating the choice to send usage statistics"
width="622px"
height="660px"
alt="Screenshot of ALS preferences showing the General tab. The Data section with Usage statistics is highlighted." >}}
{{< /center >}}

We would be very grateful if you allow ALS to send us usage statistics, but we also understand that you may be reluctant
to enable such a feature.

Please note that:

- ALS will **only** send the following information at each startup:
    - ALS version.
    - Processor type.
    - Operating system type.
- We do not seek to identify or geolocate the source of this information.

<details>
    <summary>Click here to see how you can verify these claims yourself</summary>

ALS and our tracking tools are **opensource** software, their source code is publicly available.

# Your Very First Session

{{< /center >}}

## Starting the Session

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="start.png"

alt="ALS main controls section with the Session subsection, showing the START, PAUSE, and STOP buttons. The START button is highlighted with a red arrow pointing to it. Below, indicators for Stack size (0) and Stack exposure (n/a) are displayed. The status reads 'stopped'." >}}
{{< /center >}}

üñ±Ô∏è Click `START` in the **session** section at the top left

---

ALS confirms the successful session start:

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="started.png"
caption="The session control buttons and session status are updated"
width="297px"
height="162px"
alt="ALS main controls section with the Session subsection, showing the START, PAUSE, and STOP buttons. Below these buttons, indicators for Stack size (0) and Stack exposure (n/a) are displayed. The status reads 'running' with a red arrow pointing to it." >}}
{{< /center >}}

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="status.png"
caption="The **session log** displays the latest events and the **status bar** is updated"

height="166px"
alt="Session log showing informational messages with timestamps. The entries include 'Starting new session,' 'Input scanner started,' and 'Session running in mode mean with alignment True.' Buttons labeled Acknowledge, issues only, follow. Statusbar item reads : session running" >}}
{{< /center >}}

---

üéõÔ∏è Now start the acquisitions with your usual system. ALS detects and processes each new sub.

As an example, we will illustrate the following sections with a session on Messier 27: ZWO ASI224MC camera, 200 x 4 sec.
subs

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="stacked_01.png"
caption="ALS after processing the 1<sup>st</sup> sub"
width="1920px"
height="1053px"
alt="ALS main window after processing the first sub, displaying an initial, slightly noisy image of Messier 27 nebula with scattered stars. The session log shows successful processing messages. The processing panel on the right provides histogram and level adjustments, RGB balance, and auto stretch settings." >}}
{{< /center >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
‚ÑπÔ∏è The first detected sub serves as the **alignment reference** for the entire session
{{% /alert %}}

---

All new subs are first aligned to this reference and then stacked by averaging with all previously processed
subs.

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="stacked_15.png"
caption="ALS after processing the 15<sup>th</sup> image. Contrast and noise improve"
width="1920px"
height="1053px"
alt="ALS main window after processing the 15th sub, displaying a less noisy and more detailed image of Messier 27 nebula with scattered stars. The session log shows successful processing messages. The processing panel on the right provides histogram and level adjustments, RGB balance, and auto stretch settings." >}}
{{< /center >}}

After each alignment and stacking of a new sub, ALS automatically adjusts the brightness and color balance before
displaying the result in the **central area**.

As you stack more subs, you will see the result gain in contrast and detail. The grainy appearance of the sky background
will gradually fade away.

---

## Explore

Let ALS work on the subs that keep coming in and lose yourself a bit in the **central area**:

- üñ±Ô∏è Zoom in and out using your mouse wheel
- üñ±Ô∏è Navigate the image by dragging it, like with any other viewing software
- üñ±Ô∏è Reset the zoom by right-clicking in the image

The image in the **central area** is instantly updated after each sub is processed, with no impact on navigation.

width="1920px"
height="1053px"
alt="The Astro Live Stacker (ALS) main window after processing the 200th sub, displaying a smooth, detailed, and high-contrast image of the Messier 27 nebula with numerous stars. The session log at the bottom shows successful processing messages and the image saver panel on the left indicates that the images have been saved successfully. The right panel includes processing options such as histogram adjustments, auto stretch, levels, and RGB balance." >}}

This quick start guide does not cover the other features and settings of ALS. However, ALS has been designed to be very
intuitive. Feel free to explore and experiment with the various controls located on the right side of the screen in the
**Processing** section.

## Stopping the Session

Our express guided tour is coming to an end, stop the current session.

{{< /center >}}

üñ±Ô∏è Click `STOP` in the **session** section at the top left. A confirmation window appears...

alt="Dialog box titled 'Session stop,' asking for confirmation to stop the current session with a message: 'Stopping the current session will reset the stack and all image enhancements. Are you sure you want to stop the current session?' Below the message are a checkbox labeled 'Save result before stop' and two buttons labeled 'No' and 'Yes.' The 'No' button is highlighted in red, and the 'Yes' button is highlighted in green." >}}
{{< /center >}}

üñ±Ô∏è Click `Yes`

You will find the final result of this session in the file named **stack_image.jpg** saved in the **work folder**
