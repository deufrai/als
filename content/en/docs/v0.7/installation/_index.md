# üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

Good news, ALS is not too resource-hungry.

However, you can never have too much CPU power and RAM. The more, the better! This will make ALS smoother to use. üòä

## All desktops and laptops
- Nothing special, really. Any modern system will do.

## Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi 4 minimum
- 4 GB of RAM minimum

The ALS versions available for download for Raspberry Pi are intended for 64-bit systems.

But you can easily adapt this [build script](https://github.com/deufrai/als/blob/release/0.7/ci/builds/build_dist_arm64_linux.sh)
to package a 32-bit version of ALS from the sources. The only strict requirement is to use Python version 3.6.x. Do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto://support@als-app.org) if you need help.
