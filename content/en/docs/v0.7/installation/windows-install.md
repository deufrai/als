# üì¶ Installation

1. **Open the Downloads Folder**
    - Once the download is complete, open File Explorer by clicking its icon on the taskbar (an icon shaped like a
      folder).
    - Navigate to your Downloads folder by selecting "Downloads" in the navigation menu on the left.
    - You should see the installer file that starts with `als` and ends with `_Setup.exe`. For example, it might be
      `als-v0.7-beta10_Setup.exe`.

2. **Run the Installer**
    - Double-click the `als-v0.7-beta10_Setup.exe` file in the folder where you downloaded it to launch the installation.
      If ALS is already installed on your system, this installer will proceed with an update.
    - A Windows security alert window will likely appear, indicating that the application's publisher is unknown.

3. **Handle the Security Alert**
    - Windows 10
        - Click "More info" in the alert window.
        - Then click "Run anyway".
    - Windows 11
        - Click "Show more" in the alert window.
        - Then click "Run anyway".

4. **Allow Modifications**
    - A User Account Control (UAC) window might appear, asking if you want to allow this application to make changes to
      your system.
    - Click "Yes" to allow the application to run.

5. **Allow the Application in Windows Firewall**
    - The first time you launch ALS's image server, a Windows Firewall window might open, asking if you want to allow
      the application to communicate on public and/or private networks.
    - Check the appropriate boxes based on your preferences, then click "Allow access".
