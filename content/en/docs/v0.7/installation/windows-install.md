1. **Open the Downloads folder**
   - When the download is complete, open File Explorer by clicking on its icon in the taskbar (a folder-shaped icon).
   - Access your Downloads folder by selecting "Downloads" in the navigation menu on the left.
   - You should see the executable file whose name starts with `als` and ends with `.exe`. For example, it might be `als-v0.7-beta7.exe`.

2. **Move the downloaded file to a permanent location**

   **Why move the file?**

   Moving the downloaded file to a permanent and organized location facilitates future access and improves the management of your applications and files.

   **Steps to move the downloaded file:**

   1. **Open File Explorer**
      - Click on the File Explorer icon in the taskbar (the icon looks like a folder).

   2. **Access the Downloads folder**
      - In File Explorer, use the navigation pane on the left to access "Downloads".
      - You can also click on "This PC" and then on "Downloads" under "Quick access".

   3. **Identify the ALS file**
      - In the Downloads folder, look for the file you downloaded. For example, it might be named `als-v0.7-beta7.exe`.

   4. **Create a directory for ALS**
      - Go to your home directory (`C:\Users\username`).
      - Right-click in the directory and select "New" then "Folder".
      - Name this new folder `Applications`.
      - Double-click the `Applications` folder to open it.
      - Right-click inside the `Applications` folder and select "New" then "Folder".
      - Name this folder `ALS`.

   5. **Move the ALS file to the new folder**
      - Go back to the "Downloads" folder and right-click on the `als-v0.7-beta7.exe` file.
      - Select "Cut".
      - Navigate to the `ALS` folder you just created (`C:\Users\username\Applications\ALS`).
      - Right-click in the `ALS` folder and select "Paste".

3. **Run the executable file**
   - Double-click on the `als-v0.7-beta7.exe` file in the folder where you moved it to launch the application.
   - A Windows security alert window will probably open, indicating that the application's publisher is unknown.

4. **Handle the security alert**
   - Windows 10
     - Click on "More info" in the alert window.
     - Then click on "Run anyway".
   - Windows 11
     - Click on "Show more" in the alert window.
     - Then click on "Run anyway".

5. **Allow changes**
   - A User Account Control (UAC) window may open, asking if you want to allow this app to make changes to your system.
   - Click "Yes" to allow the app to run.

6. **Allow the app in Windows Firewall**
   - The first time you launch ALS, a Windows Firewall window may open, asking if you want to allow the app to communicate on public and/or private networks.
   - Check the appropriate boxes according to your preferences, then click "Allow access".
