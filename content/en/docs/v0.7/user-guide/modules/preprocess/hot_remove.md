# Overview

The **HotPixelRemove** process removes hot pixels from the image.

Its configuration is managed via ALS preferences.

| Image | image received from the **Preprocess** module |

# Behavior

Each pixel in the image whose value deviates too much from its neighbors is considered a hot pixel.

Its value is replaced by the average value of its neighbors.

# Output

The modified image is sent back to the **Preprocess** module.
