**Let yourself be guided!** We will show you everything you need to know about ALS for smooth and optimal use, tailored 
to **your** needs.

# Conventions
First, let's define the context in which we will operate.

## Stepping into the character...

Throughout this journey, you will embody a new ALS user:
- **Username**: Your username is **astrogeek**
- **System used**: You use ALS on a Linux system
- **Organization of captured images**: The images captured by your acquisition system are saved in the **astroshots** 
folder in your home directory, organized by target with the captures in **Lights** subfolders. For example, 
for an imaging session of Messier 27:

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="lights_placement.png" 
    caption="raw captured images organization" 
    width="899px" 
    height="479px" 
    alt="captures folder content" >}}
{{< /center >}}

## Typography

Throughout this documentation, the following pictograms and text styles will be used to indicate specific elements 
and actions:

- This is a `graphical user interface element`
- This is an **important information**
- This icon üñ±Ô∏è indicates that a mouse action is required
- This icon ‚å®Ô∏è indicates that a keyboard action is required
- This icon üéõÔ∏è indicates that an action outside of ALS is required
