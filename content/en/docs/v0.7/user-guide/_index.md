**Let yourself be guided!** We will show you everything you need to know about ALS for smooth and optimal use, tailored
to **your** needs.

# Conventions

First, let's define the terms and formatting we will use throughout this guide.

## Glossary

calibration
: Set of processes applied to subs to eliminate sensor defects. This generally includes hot pixel removal and the
subtraction of a master dark to reduce thermal noise.

master dark
: Calibration image containing the sensor's thermal noise. It is subtracted from the subs during calibration to reduce
thermal noise in the images before stacking.

session
: the lifecycle of the current stack, starting with the first detected sub, processing each new sub until the session is
stopped.

stack
: Set of subs stacked since the start of the session

sub
: Image captured by your acquisition system

# In the shoes of the character... {#character}

Throughout this journey, you will embody a new ALS user:

- **Username**: Your username is **astrogeek**
- **System used**: You use ALS on a Linux system
- **Organization of subs**: Your acquisition system saves the subs in the **astroshots** folder of your home
  directory, organized by target with subs in **Light** subfolders.

  Example: Session on Messier 27, the subs are saved in the **astroshots/M_27/Light** folder.
