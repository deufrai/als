# In the shoes of the character...

Throughout this journey, you will embody a new ALS user:

- **Username**: Your username is **astrogeek**
- **System used**: You use ALS on a Linux system
- **Organization of subs**: Your acquisition system saves the subs in the **astroshots** folder of your home
  directory, organized by target with subs in **Light** subfolders.

  Example: Session on Messier 27, the subs are saved in the **astroshots/M_27/Light** folder.
