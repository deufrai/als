**Let yourself be guided!** We will show you everything you need to know about ALS for smooth and optimal use, tailored to **your** needs.

# Conventions
First, let's define the context in which we will operate.

## Stepping into the character...

Throughout this journey, you will embody a new ALS user:
- **Username**: His username is **astrogeek**
- **System used**: He uses ALS on a Linux system
- **Organization of captured images**: The images captured by his acquisition system are saved in the **astroshots** folder in his home directory, organized by target with the captures in **Lights** subfolders. For example, for an imaging session of Messier 27:

{{< center >}}
{{< figure src="lights_placement.png" >}}
{{< /center >}}
