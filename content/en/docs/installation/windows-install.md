### Instructions for Running ALS on Windows

1. **Open the Downloads Folder**:
   - When the download is complete, open File Explorer by clicking its icon in the taskbar (a folder-shaped icon).
   - Navigate to your downloads folder by selecting "Downloads" from the navigation menu on the left.
   - You should see the executable file whose name starts with `als` and ends with `.exe`. For example, it might be `als-v0.7-beta6.exe`.

2. **Run the Executable File**:
   - Double-click the `als-v0.7-beta6.exe` file to launch the application.
   - A Windows security alert window will likely appear, indicating the publisher of the application is unknown.

3. **Handle the Security Alert**:
   - Windows 10:
     - Click "More info" in the alert window.
     - Then click "Run anyway".
   - Windows 11:
     - Click "Show more" in the alert window.
     - Then click "Run anyway".

4. **Allow Changes**:
   - A User Account Control (UAC) window will open, asking if you want to allow this application to make changes to your device.
   - Click "Yes" to allow the application to run.

5. **Allow the Application in Windows Firewall**:
   - The first time you launch ALS, a Windows firewall window may open, asking if you want to allow the application to communicate on public and/or private networks.
   - Check the appropriate boxes based on your preferences, then click "Allow access".

Enjoy using ALS! ðŸš€âœ¨
