        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>ALS was born from an initial attempt at livestacking using <a href="https://stellarmate.com/downloads/ekos/category/2-ekos.html" target="_blank">Ekos</a> to control <a href="https://siril.org/" target="_blank">Siril</a> through custom shell scripts. These shell scripts then evolved into Python code. What started as a small toy for a few friends spending their nights photographing the universe has grown into a full-fledged application used worldwide.</p>
