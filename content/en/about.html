                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>ALS was born from an initial attempt at livestacking using <a
                        href="https://stellarmate.com/downloads/ekos/category/2-ekos.html" target="_blank">Ekos</a> to
                    control
                    <a href="https://siril.org/" target="_blank">Siril</a> via custom shell scripts. These shell scripts
                    then evolved into Python code. What started as a small toy for a few friends spending their nights
                    photographing the universe has grown into a full-fledged application used worldwide.
